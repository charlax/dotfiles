Installation
============

    $ curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charlax/dotvim/master/install.py | python

You should read the script before executing it.

Prerequisites
=============

Install MacVim on Mac Os X
--------------------------

You need [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/). Dependencies will be installed automatically.

Plugins
=======

I am using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

* Add a plugin by adding a `Plug` line in `vimrc`, then add its description
  below.
* Update plugins with `:PlugUpdate`.
* Upgrade vim-plug from time to time with `:PlugUpgrade`.
* Remove a plugin by removing the line, running `:PlugClean` and removing the
  description from the `README.md`. Look for other mentions of the plugin in
  the repo by using `ag`.

How to try Vim
==============

If you want to try Vim, just follow these steps:

1. Read [Seven habits of effective text
   editing](http://www.moolenaar.net/habits.html) by Bram Moolenaar (Vim's main
   author)
2. Resist the urge to use a plugin or anyone elseâ€™s `vimrc`.
   [Really](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/2011/12/vim-revisited/).
3. Use `vimtutor` to learn the basics.
4. Along the way, add plugins and improve your `.vimrc` little by little,
   making sure you understand and comment all your options.

Feel free to read my article: [Why I use
Vim](http://blog.d3in.org/post/14220797290/why-i-keep-on-using-vim-instead-of-going-back-to)

Here's some other good articles:

* [A Good Vimrc](http://dougblack.io/words/a-good-vimrc.html)

Reference card
