# Create bcrypt password
# -b takes password as arg
# -n outputs to stdout

# -C 10 sets bcrypt cost to 10
# tr to remove useless empty lines and sed to change format version
htpasswd -bnBC 10 "" yourpassword | tr -d ':\n' | sed 's/$2y/$2a/'

# $2b$[cost]$[22 character salt][31 character hash]
# $2$, $2a$, $2b$ indicate different version of bcrypt
