# To create a symlink:
# mnemo:
# "ln is like cp, source needs to come first"
# "symbolic link to source, and call it location"
# "like mv and cp, ln takes an existing file as first arg"
# "ln source target"
ln -s <source-location> <symlink-location>
# For instance:
ln -s ../styles.css styles.css

# To symlink, while overwriting existing destination files
ln -sf <source-location> <symlink-location>

# Watch out for existing target directory
# Without -n, this will create /target/target -> source
ln -sfn source /target
